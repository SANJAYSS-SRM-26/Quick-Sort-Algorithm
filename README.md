# Quick-Sort-Algorithm
This repository contains a C implementation of the Quicksort algorithm. Quicksort is a popular sorting algorithm known for its efficiency and speed. The code is written in C, providing a simple and efficient way to sort arrays of integers.

# Files Included:
quicksort.c: This file contains the implementation of the Quicksort algorithm in C.

README.md: This README file provides information about the Quicksort algorithm and instructions for using the provided C code.

# Algorithm Description:
Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then recursively sorted. This process continues until the entire array is sorted.
